       <div> <h1>A Little Bit <span class= "cl1">About Me</span>  </h1>
        <p>For more than 5 years now, design has been the central
            of my world. On this fast and mind-blowing journey, I 
            have moved over the years from being a visual designer to
            a full-time UX/UI thinker and designer.</p>
         <p> At the moment, this journey has brough me to US Mobile
             where I am a full-time Senior Product Designer. In this
             position, as with freelance, I am working remotely and I have been for
             approximately two years.
         </p>   
         <p>With the constant goal of pushing design boundaries and 
             maintaining a high standard for useability & user experience,
             I have consistently worked with various startups and clients from all around the world
             and helped them create amazing and engaging digital products.
